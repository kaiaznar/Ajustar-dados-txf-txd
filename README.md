# Ajustar-dados-txf-txd
This code was built to produce a data accurated table of force(F) values against deslocation(d), from two diferent tables ( time x force; time x deslocation) where the variable time was not the same in both tables. This particular project was very challenge because the data was a from sensor in mecanical testing, which is a senoidal pattern and vibrations.

So was necessary to apply several conditions in the code to be able to treate the real data
